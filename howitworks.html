        <p id="h2">The Process</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mining:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; Once you hit 'Start Mining,' Arbux Miner uses your device to solve tough problems (kind of like solving hundreds of tricky math puzzles) that help with cryptocurrency mining.</li>
            <li><strong>Earning:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; As your device works, you earn credits. These credits can be exchanged for Robux at a fair rate when you cash out.</li>
            <li><strong>Payout:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; When you reach the minimum balance, we check your mining activity and pay you based on how much your device has mined.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="security gen">
        <p id="h2">Safety and Privacy</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We only use your email to link your rewards and any other info you give us willingly. We don’t access anything personal or secret.</li>
            <li>The mining process is designed to run in the background, using your device’s power without locking it up. You can still use your computer while the miner works!</li>
            <li>Your device has a unique ID (UID) to make sure your rewards are tracked correctly and securely.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="benefits gen">
        <p id="h2">Why Choose Arbux Miner?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Upfront Costs:</strong> Arbux Miner is completely free to download and use, but we keep a very small portion of your earnings to help maintain the service and keep it running smoothly for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Set Up:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; Start earning Robux without any complicated setup. No need to create wallets or mess with miners. Just download, link your email, and start mining!</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Income:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; Let your device do the work while you relax. It’s better to earn something while doing nothing than earn nothing while doing nothing!</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Conversion Rates:</strong><br>&emsp;&emsp; We make sure your hard work is rewarded fairly with Robux.</li>
        </ul>
