        <div class="faq-item">
            <p id="h3">How does Arbux Miner work?</p>
            <p>Arbux Miner allows you to earn rewards effortlessly while your device is running. For detailed information, check out our <a href="howitworks.html">How It Works</a> page!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p id="h3">Is the earning process slow?</p>
            <p>It depends on your computer's hardware. Better hardware and more time run = Higher rewards. If your earnings are slow, don‚Äôt worry! It‚Äôs important to remember that Arbux Miner generates idle income. Earning slowly is still better than earning nothing at all!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p id="h3">Is there any risk involved?</p>
            <p>Arbux Miner is designed to be safe and easy to use. Ensure that you follow correct instructions while installing otherwise Arbux Miner may not produce rewards. (Any error during installation is usually pointed out when you click 'Start Mining' in the Arbux Client webapp.)</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p id="h3">Can I use Arbux Miner on multiple devices?</p>
            <p>Yes, you can use it on whatever device you want if it supports our application. Each device will have its own UID (unique identifier).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p id="h3">What is a UUID or UID?</p>
            <p>UUID or UID (Unique Identifier) is like a combination of password and username, so don't share it to anyone. It is linked to the email you enter and is randomly generated. It represents your device and can be used for many actions, such as to withdraw Robux earned by that device.</p>
